A computer is essential for programming. It provides the necessary tools and environment to write, test, and debug code efficiently. Without a computer, developing software and running complex simulations would be impossible.

## Why Windows instead of macOS?

I chose Windows over Mac primarily for gaming, as macOS is not ideal for that. Additionally, for development, I can utilize Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), making it convenient to access Linux tools and environments.

As a university student, I chose a laptop over a desktop mainly due to budget constraints, as I can't afford a second computer. Portability is crucial for me, allowing me to work from anywhere, which is why I opted for a laptop.

My main development device right now is a Razer Blade 15 2022 Advanced. I originally bought it because it was on sale, otherwise, I had planned to purchase the ROG Zephyrus G14. This Razer laptop, with its 11th Gen i7 and RTX 3070, has made me very satisfied for both development and gaming.
