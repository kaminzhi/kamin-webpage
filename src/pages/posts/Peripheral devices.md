## Monitor：AOC 24B1H

While this monitor isn't the best quality, at least its colors don't drift too much, and I've been using it for six years without any major issues.  
(Though recently, there have been some connectivity problems with the ports.)

## Mouse：Logitech G502 Lightspeed

<br>

This mouse is extremely convenient for me, whether it's for work or gaming. The customizable weights allow me to adjust it to the perfect weight for my liking.

## Keyboard：Royal Kludge RK84 Pro

The standout features of this keyboard are its support for triple-platform connectivity, hot-swappable switches, and affordable price. It offers a satisfying typing experience, and what I like most is that it retains the functionality of the F1 to F12 keys and the HOME and END keys

## Headset：Razer Barracuda X

<br>

The sound quality of this headset is just average. Its only standout feature is its ability to connect wirelessly, but I usually opt for the wired connection.

## Microphone：HyperX QuadCast

This microphone boasts several convenient features. Firstly, it has a touch-sensitive mute function, allowing for quick muting without fumbling with buttons; a simple tap on the top is all it takes. Additionally, it comes with a built-in pop filter and offers four selectable recording modes, making it versatile for various application environments. Its actual recording performance is quite impressive, delivering clear and crisp sound

## Speaker: Logitech LS21

<br>

These budget 2.1 channel speakers offer average sound quality, but they excel in delivering deep bass that you can feel.
