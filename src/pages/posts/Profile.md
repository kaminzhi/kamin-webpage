## Here are my own thoughts

As a student majoring in Information Management, I am filled with anticipation and readiness for the next three years. I aim to delve deeply into the core courses related to information management, mastering skills in data analysis, system development and management, and cybersecurity. This will lay a solid foundation for my future career in the industry. I plan to actively seek internship opportunities both on and off campus, applying theoretical knowledge to practical work to enhance my hands-on experience. Additionally, I will participate in various technical competitions and seminars to expand my network and stay updated with the latest industry trends.

Beyond academics, I hope to improve my overall skills, including leadership, communication, and teamwork, as these soft skills are equally important in the professional world. I will engage in club activities and community service projects to enrich my college life while gaining more social experience. In essence, I am determined to fully commit myself to learning and growing over these three years, building a solid foundation to achieve my career goals and life aspirations.
