## My Reflections

<br>

This computer was assembled by me using second-hand parts, some of which were leftover from previous builds. Therefore, the total cost of assembling this machine was less than NT$4000 (excluding the hard drive). Currently, this computer is stored in the living room of my current residence and operates continuously without being turned off throughout the day.
